# Occlusion Detection and Completion Script

This script processes grayscale images to detect occlusions and complete the occluded areas using morphological operations. It uses OpenCV for image processing and Matplotlib for visualization.

## Features

- **Grayscale Image Processing**: Handles grayscale images for detecting and completing occlusions.
- **Morphological Operations**: Applies erosion, dilation, and closing to complete the occluded areas.
- **Visualization**: Displays the original image, binary mask, and results of morphological operations.
- **Saving Results**: Optionally saves intermediate and final images to disk.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. **Save the Script**: Save the provided Python script to a file, for example, `occlusion_detection.py`.

2. **Run the Script**: Execute the script from the command line. You will be prompted to enter the path to the grayscale image.

    ```bash
    python occlusion_detection.py
    ```

3. **Provide Image Path**: Enter the full path to the grayscale image when prompted.

4. **View Results**: The script will display a series of images showing the original image, binary mask, and results of morphological processing. It will also save the results as PNG files in the current directory.

## Example

```bash
Enter the path to the image: /path/to/your/image.png
```

The following images will be generated and saved:
- `eroded_mask.png`: Mask after erosion.
- `dilated_mask.png`: Mask after dilation.
- `closed_mask.png`: Mask after closing.
- `completed_mask.png`: Final mask after additional dilation.
- `completed_image.png`: Image with the occluded parts completed.

## Code Explanation

- **Loading Image**: The script reads a grayscale image using OpenCV.
- **Thresholding**: Converts the image to a binary mask.
- **Morphological Operations**: 
  - **Erosion**: Removes small-scale noise.
  - **Dilation**: Fills small holes and gaps.
  - **Closing**: Fills the occluded areas using a larger kernel.
  - **Further Dilation**: Expands filled areas.
- **Mask Application**: Applies the completed mask to the original image.
- **Visualization**: Displays the results using Matplotlib.
- **Saving Results**: Saves intermediate and final images as PNG files.

## Troubleshooting

- **Error Loading Image**: Ensure the image path is correct and the file format is supported. The script handles grayscale images.
- **Dependency Issues**: Ensure all required packages are installed. If you encounter issues, consider creating a virtual environment and reinstalling the dependencies.
